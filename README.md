## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lucas, an undergraduate studying AnÃ¡lise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas (System Analisys and Development) at Instituto Federal de CiÃªncias e Tecnologia de SÃ£o Paulo - CÃ¢mpus SÃ£o Carlos (IFSP/SCL).

I am currently seeking internship opportunities in backend and/or full stack development, as well as software modeling and design challenges to improve my skills. Furthermore, I wish to acquire knowledge and specialize in AI and IoT in the future.

<!--## What am I learning?
I have been practicing and improving my skills mainly in backend development with Kotlin/Java, junit for testing and spring boot. Additionally, I have projects in which I use ExpressJs and React for full stack development in Node. 

In both projects, I am using DDD concepts to create maintainable, extensible software that represents its domains appropriately.-->

## Which projects am I currently working in?
I'm currently working on two projects and will add a third to the list.

### [StArt](https://github.com/pet-ads/systematic)
First, I am working on the project to port the StArt tool, used to assist the Systematic Literature Review process, to the WEB version. I participate in the project as a member of the PET/ADS group. This project allows me to improve my skills in backend development using Koltin, JUnit 5 for testing and Spring Boot.

### [Remember Your Childhood](https://github.com/lucas-sdalmeida/remember-your-childhood)
Remember Your Childhood is a personal project that was born out of a college class. The idea of this project is to create a web-list where you can save your memories of series, animations, films and books that were important to your childhood and then share them with other users. This project is being built using TypeScript, ExpressJs and NodeJs for the server and using ReactJs for the client side.
